                            <p>Станок-пресс для снаряжения патронов LEE Load-ALL2. 6 600 ₽ Уфа.  8 янв 2013  Станок Lee Load All II. Демонстрация возможностей. Покупался на Райберте: Прямая ссылка на тему:. 13 июл 2017  Пришла в голову простая идея, как тратить меньше времени и не пачкать руки. 
Станок Lee load all 2 предназначен для снаряжения патронов 12, 16 и 20 калибра в домашних условиях. С его помощью можно снаряжать дробные.

I've got a lot of great feedback through Reddit and spoke with lots of helpful and encouraging people in regard to my music, but I'd love to expand my audience. Чтобы снаряжать патроны с помощью пресса Lee Load ALL 2 достаточно иметь на столе только пресс, коробку с пустыми гильзами и коробку с пыжами. 2 дек 2018  После последнего выезда на стрельбище, пулевых патронов практически не осталось, отстрелял более трех сотен. ## Welcome to the weekly competition for Apr 2019 Week 5!
