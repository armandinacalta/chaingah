                            <p> Just a reminder. Timestamp + Photos ( Selling two Nintendo Switch games. Both are used in great/like new condition. Literally only played Lego Worlds one time with my little cousin. Captain Toad was a gift and I barely played it. Not really my type of game. Lego Worlds -  shipped OBO ~~Captain Toad Treasure Tracker -  shipped OBO~~ Or I'll sell them both for  shipped Payment via PayPal. I have a verified PayPal and will send you a PayPal invoice with the item descriptio. I'm not really sure what games I've played that would be similar to it besides like Mario Odyssey but I played the demo and it seems fun. However, the price tag is a little off-putting so basically, is it worth it? How long is it? Edit: Also, what are some other good but relaxing games on the switch, wii u, or 3ds? I'm looking more so for games on the switch but I have all 3. I'm also looking into AC:New Leaf and Yoshi's Woolly World.I wanted Crafted World but that's 
I always found this game interesting, the demo fun but a bit too expensive to actually buy it. During a retailer sale I did finally buy it and i am really glad i did. The game is so much fun. It's a nice little puzzle game, not too hard not too easy, with lots to do. There are about 64 level, each with four different things to do. Including a very fun Hide and Seek part and a time challenge (which I haven't done) On some levels I even sat quite a while to get done everything. Both games are CiB and in like new condition. Wii U version, since I already owned it from when it first released. I played it in waves, but finally powered through the rest of the last episode tonight. This game is overall a really solid puzzler. The levels are all pretty solid, and feel really satisfying, and the game is gorgeous (being able to reuse the Mario 3D World engine really helped, you can just tell. Lots of brand-new assets). I also really liked the levels that focused on stealth, which is strange considering I don't usually. 
Captain toad is cheaper which i count as a plus but is yoshis crafted world a better. https://www.amazon.ca/Captain-Toad-Treasure-Tracker-Switch/dp/B07D7Q8KDD/ref=sr\_1\_9?crid=1HCGV3U6NIMUGampkeywords=switch+gamesampqid=1554426471amps=videogamesampsprefix=switch+%2Cvideogames%2C227ampsr=1-9 (https://www.amazon.ca/Captain-Toad-Treasure-Tracker-Switch/dp/B07D7Q8KDD/ref=sr_1_9?crid=1HCGV3U6NIMUGampkeywords=switch+gamesampqid=1554426471amps=videogamesampsprefix=switch+%2Cvideogames%2C227ampsr=1-9). I recently picked up Captain toad for switch since I like puzzle games in general and also was getting a used copy for reduced price . My nephews ( 8 and 11 yr old ) visited me over the weekend and we played some of the usual mario kart, snipper clips . they come over usually so they know about those games. Cpt toad was lying around and I thought of making them give a try. First few levels they needed some help from me , telling them about stars , golden mushrooms the basic controls Rep thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/mushroomkingdom/comments/97ajb7/uxakantor\_successful\_trade\_thread/ (https://www.reddit.com/r/mushroomkingdom/comments/97ajb7/uxakantor_successful_trade_thread/) amp#x200B; Switch :- :- ~~Pokemon Let's Go Eevee~~ https://imgur.com/a/d0c6qgj (https://imgur.com/a/d0c6qgj) amp#x200B; DS :- :- Dragon Ball Z: Harukanaru Densetsu https://imgur.com/a/0lLN9kV (https://imgur.com/a/0lLN9kV) amp#x200B; 3DS :- :- Rune Factory 4 https. Download link! http://vaugette.com/2ax4. Bought the Game finaly on Black Friday the first time i bought it it is really awsome. Only Nintendo could build such a game with over 70 Levels full of creativity. Its also very child friendly my 6 Year old Daughter loves the game. Its almost like a mario 3d world just without jumping. so much variety in the levels. If you considering buying the game i can only say give it a chance its really great. </p>
